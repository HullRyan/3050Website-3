            Introduction to Computational Thinking

        </button>
        <div class="collapsibleContent">
            <p>
                Computational thinking is the step that comes before programming. It’s the process of breaking down a
                problem into simple enough steps that even a computer would understand. We all know that computers take
                instructions very literally, sometimes to comic results. If we don’t provide computers with instructions
                that are precise and detailed, your algorithm might forget vital actions that most people take for
                granted.

                For example, consider a simple activity like brushing your teeth. At first it sounds like a simple
                enough task, but in fact, brushing your teeth involves many simple steps. First, you’ll need a
                toothbrush and toothpaste. You’ll need a sink with cold water. You’ll need to put the toothpaste on the
                brush. Don’t forget to turn on the water and run your brush underneath. As you see, such a simple
                activity actually involves many steps, if you miss one step or put one out of order you might end up
                with a huge mess! There are four major skills in computational thinking:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Decomposition</li>
                <li>Pattern Recognition</li>
                <li>Pattern Abstraction</li>
                <li>Algorithm Design</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Decomposition</h3>
            <p>
                Decomposition is the idea of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, easier to manage pieces. With
                children you can teach decomposition by getting them to teach you how to perform a simple task. Simple
                activities like brushing teeth, preparing food, or reading are great starters for understanding the
                process. Students will need to break down the task into small easy steps. Ensure that the steps are only
                ones that are required in order to complete the task. If in need of a challenge then another way to
                teach this concept is by having your student build something by only seeing the final product. Provide
                your student with the supplies needed and allow them to figure out the steps required to complete the
                project. With this activity you can understand the basics of decomposition.
            </p>
            <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
            <p>
                People are generally already good at recognizing patterns, however it is still vital when trying to
                understand computational thinking. Pattern recognition is all about identifying a repeated pattern or
                problem and considering if any solutions encountered in the past apply here. One practical way to think
                about this is by comparing it to building a piece of furniture from IKEA. Something like a set of
                drawers requires that each drawer be built individually, when building the first one it's common to make
                a couple mistakes and to take a long time. As you continue to build the identical drawers you gain an
                understanding of the process that is required and avoid the mistakes made in the past. When we repeat
                steps in the build we learn to solve the instructions more quickly and efficiently.
            </p>
            <h3>Pattern generalization and abstraction</h3>
            <p>
                Pattern generalization helps to teach about identifying relevant details needed in solving a problem and
                disregarding details that are not important to the task at hand. The process of identifying crucial info
                and ignoring irrelevant data is one of the hardest parts of computational learning. One common and
                popular example of pattern generalization are escape rooms. Many escape rooms contain irrelevant details
                and props that aim to distract from the puzzle needed to be solved. Setting up an escape room at home
                can be a great way to teach the concept of pattern generalization.
            </p>
            <h3>Algorithm design</h3>
            <p>
                While an algorithm sounds complicated and technical, it is at its most basic just a process or set of
                rules to be followed. Algorithm design is identifying and determining the steps and rules needed to be
                followed in order to achieve the same outcome every time. One simple example for this is to have you and
                your student each write down a set of instructions for creating something, for example a peanut butter
                and jelly sandwich. Then trade your instructions and attempt to follow the others instructions exactly.
                Doing this you may find that some steps like putting the peanut butter and jelly away may or may not
                have been included, steps like these can be very crucial when determining a good algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trying some of these out with your student can give them a sense of what computational thinking is and how it can be applied, many free online resources are available for expanding upon your computational thinking skills, some of our favorites are listed on this website.

            <p>When considering the future for your student it's important to think about the availability of the career
                they're interested in. Fortunately computer science is one of the most in demand degrees right now and
                has
                seen dramatic growth since 1990. Computer scientists are also being paid more now than ever before.
                According to the <a
