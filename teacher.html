            <p>Computational thinking is like many things process to make things easier like the Scientific method. 
			It is way to think like a computer and solve like they would. However our brains aren't automatically 
			wired to think in simple terms of zeros and ones so we must adapt our brains to best do that. A good
			way to so would be to play some math games with thems so they can start thinking in binary
			since it's in binary and doing simple multiples of 2 such as 4, 8, 16 will help to get their
			minds thinking in ways of the computer which is the first step. Then you can go on to more computer
			logic related questions such as what is on and off in terms of computer and how can it go from there.

		Here's a link to video on it that you can show to your students that easily help to break it down for them.

		How to Get Coding Through to Kids of All Ages

			Getting to Computation Thinking across is a start to getting a kid to understand coding
			it isn't everything. In order to truly understand what coding is they must understand how
			code helps a program to run. Computers aren't as complex at all when it comes down to it. In
			fact they are dumb machine who understand stuff in on and zeros. We are the ones that have the power.
			With that power we code the computer do certain tasks endlessly. In a way it we send code in our computers
			is like how our brains signal to our bodies what to do. Without our brains we wouldn't be able to function
			the way we do. It is this concept that we must get throught to them
			</p>
			<p>
			These tasks don't have to be complicated it can just be a line that says "Hello World!" or
			in a case of a brain raising an arm. We can used these basic tasks to solve more challenging ones
			such as creating a website are walking across the room. That's it what makes coding so interesting
			and fun to do.

			<p> When it comes to middle schoolers it hard to keep their attention as the constantly do and worry about other
			things However it can be reduced. Student engagement is a must if they are to learn programming. A good way to do this
			is to throw a suprise quiz at them. While they may not be prepared at first when they see they failed the quiz, it will
			surely increase attentiveness. On the less grade threatening side of things there are multitude of online quiz creators such
			as Kahoot which can help to increase competition. Competition is always good not only for a student's ego but for their
			understanding as well. After these two, the last one is the most simple of the bunch, if they are listening just
			call on them and they won't probably answer the first time but knowing that you could call on them at any time definitely will
			keep them awake.
