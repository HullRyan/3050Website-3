TODO
1. Update the teacher content to include lesson plans that have realistic applications to teachers' classrooms. I recommend looking for online teaching resources like the ones we provide in the online resource links. Add publications that discuss different applications of CT and benefits of CT. Add additional diagrams/photos that demonstrate what computation thinking is.

3. YearOne Page needs some work still
