            <h2>How does code work</h2>
            <p>Firstly it is important to note that different programming languages operate differently and as such have
                different rules about what can and cannot be done with the language. In this example we will
                specifically be
                talking about
                object orientated programming languages and their uses. Computer code follows a step-by-step process
                of reading each line of its instruction written by the programmer and executing each instruction one at
                a
                time. This step-by-step process is done through a compiler that actually reads the written code and
                turns it
                into even more basic code that the machine can better understand.</p>
            <img alt="Python code declaring a boolean variable and checking if true or not"
                 src="images/isAwesomeEx.jpg">
            <br>
            <img alt="output of python code saying 'Wow! this is awesome'" src="images/IsAwesomeExOutput.jpg">
            <p>In the image above the code is written in Python. We can see that each line of code is numbered and
                contains
                unique code that completes a set of
                instructions. We can refer to a specific instruction by its line number, on line 1 some code is written
                to
                create a variable called isAwesome that holds in it a boolean value which can be either true or false,
                on
                this line we have set it to true. On line 3 there is an if statement which is a
                component of python and many other languages that allows for a true or false comparison that when
                evaluated
                at
                true runs the code inside its scope (the indented line(s) under it) and if false it skips over the
                braces to
                the next thing
                written. Inside the if statement is written (isAwesome == true) this is a comparison that checks the
                value
                of the variable called isAwesome and checks to see if it's the same as true. If the comparison is true
                then
                we print out "Wow! this is awesome" and if it's false we print out "This doesn't seem very awesome."</p>
            <p>Here is the same coding example except designed in scratch using block based coding.</p>

            <h3>Draw a Flower</h3>
            <p>The pen is a fantastic tool to use in Scratch as it emulates one of the most basic programs in computer
                science, the turtle. In this scratch activity we will be using the pen tool to show off how simple loops
                can lead to very pretty and pleasing designs. By the end of this activity you will have made something
                that looks like the gif on the homepage of this website.</p>
